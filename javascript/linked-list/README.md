# Singly Linked List

Create a singly linked list and associated tests to ensure they are passing.

## Challenge

Create a Node class and a Linked List class with three methods (insert, includes, toString). Write tests to prove the following functionality:

- Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
- Can properly insert into the linked list
- The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
- Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
- Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
- Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
- Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list

## Approach & Efficiency

I worked with Jess Parker (props to her for helping these concepts make more sense!), and classmates Tray Chea and Alex Grazda to discuss the best ways to make create the methods as well as the tests.

## API

<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
